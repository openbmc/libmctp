      "message": "So we used to use struct mctp_bus to represent attaching an EID to a binding (essentially, just a (binding, eid) pair). Now that we\u0027re using the route table, is that separation of binding and bus still needed? ie., should we move all of this into struct mctp_binding perhaps?\n\n[This may help with future confusion - you have mctp_bus_* functions below that operate on a binding, not a bus]",
