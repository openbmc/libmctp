There\u0027s more info on the process here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#starting-out\n\nAre you happy to do so? Generally we encourage a corporate CLA if that suits your circumstances. If not an individual CLA is also fine.",

It says \"Apache-2.0\" or \"GPLv2+\" license.\nWhich one is it, or do both apply in the sense that you are free to adhere to the one you prefer? If you are the right person to answer this question?
