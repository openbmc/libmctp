      "message": "Yeah, I\u0027m fine with your suggestion. Just from experience some seem to have the impression they need to use a library to abstract over kernel interfaces (true in other circumstances; libgpiod, liburing etc), so I think it\u0027s worth emphasising it\u0027s not necessary here. The link to the doc wasn\u0027t so much promotional as directly demonstrating that. Maybe https://docs.kernel.org/networking/mctp.html is better, but if you don\u0027t think we need it then I\u0027m happy to not have it.",
