      "message": "Hmm. We could move it into the mctp_bus struct which is internal. As long as there is only one binding per bus it would work? \n\nOr we could consider how necessary this is. In the case I want this for there are two bindings using the bridge, and if you generate a pcap (without this patch) you can determine which packet came from which binding by looking at which eid it came from and the order it appears in.",
