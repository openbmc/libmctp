      "message": "The enum is called *_kcs_cmd but the members are called KCS_DATA, which seems confusing. Further, commands can only be sent via KCS, so I think that\u0027s an implementation detail we could remove from the type, e.g. call the type \u0027enum mctp_astlpc_cmd\u0027. If we go down this path, I\u0027d drop the KCS_* prefix from the member names as well.\n\nFurther, it\u0027s probably good to have some case consistency with the `enum mctp_astlpc_buffer_state` members. Lower case looks less shouty. But maybe we\u0027re already inconsistent with this?",
