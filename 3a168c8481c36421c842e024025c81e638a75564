      "message": "Bare in mind that this is the public header for the binding, that is, the declarations that a user will have access to by including the header.\n\nMost of the above are implementation details. I much prefer those are placed in the `.c` file and not in the header, as we don\u0027t have any motivation to expose them. Rather, we have a motivation to avoid exposing them, as otherwise we\u0027re stuck maintaining them forever (someone will use them for something and prevent us from removing them).",

What other code are the definitions and macros going to be shared with?\n\nMaybe there\u0027s some scope for sharing some of the definitions and macros with astlpc.c, but that\u0027s not how the patch is written currently. That\u0027s also a cleanup we can do later on. I think it\u0027s probably easier if we keep these changes isolated for the moment.",
