I much prefer those are placed in the `.c` file and not in the header, as we don\u0027t have any motivation to expose them. Rather, we have a motivation to avoid exposing them, as otherwise we\u0027re stuck maintaining them forever (someone will use them for something and prevent us from removing them).",
