      "message": "So we have bools here, and that\u0027s fine, however how do you feel about adding macros for true/false that help describe the direction at the point of invocation. For example:\n\n #define MCTP_CAPTURE_OUTGOING true\n #define MCTP_CAPTURE_INCOMING false\n\nWe\u0027ve done similar over here: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/libmctp/+/57959/9/libmctp.h#40\n\nHappy to bikeshed the names :) Also happy to take the idea in a later patch.",
