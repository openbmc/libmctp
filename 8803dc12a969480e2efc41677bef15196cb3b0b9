      "message": "Generally I would push back on changing the prototype of a public API. This problem is usually dealt with by adding a variant of the function with a different symbol name and deprecating the existing one. However, I think we have mitigating circumstances: `mctp_astlpc_init_fileio()` is not useful in freestanding environments, and the only significant application linking against libmctp under Linux is mctp-demux-daemon, which is fixed by this patch.",
