They\u0027d need to fix the MTU, and it\u0027s not obvious to me *how* the binding should determine this needs to happen, other than it should never happen in the first place.\n\n\u003e This would only be triggered by a bug in the binding, right? (having tx enabled with an invalid MTU). We could even assert()...\n\nWell, is asserting wise for bindings which can negotiate the value at runtime? I guess what\u0027s still going for assert() is that if the binding managed to negotiate a value below the BTU then it\u0027s still a bug in the binding, but asserting here still makes me a little nervous.",
