      "message": "I assumed you had just worked on the libpldm one a bunch and it was a good clang-format to use as a starting point for C repos.  I\u0027m fine if you want to make changes one way or the other.  I don\u0027t know where this particular one came from and it is referencing clang-format-really-old in comments.\n\nI don\u0027t really care what the .clang-format looks like for C repos except that we come up with a consistent one we can apply everywhere.  Honestly, I don\u0027t really understand why we choose to have a different one for C vs C++ as none of this code is contributed to the kernel... but my amount of care is pretty low.",
